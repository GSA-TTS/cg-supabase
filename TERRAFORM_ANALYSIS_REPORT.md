# Terraform Configuration Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current state of the cg-supabase Terraform configuration and identifies issues that would prevent a successful `terraform apply`. **Recent fixes have resolved the s3-private module configuration issues.**

## Current Issues Preventing Deployment

### 1. **~~Missing Required Variables~~** ✅ FIXED
- ~~`cf_space_id` is required but not available from current configuration~~ - Now properly defined and passed
- ~~S3 module argument mismatch~~ - Fixed to use correct cf_space_id argument
- Several variables are defined but not properly passed between modules

### 2. **Variable Mismatch Issues** ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED
- ~~Root module passes variables that don't exist in supabase module~~ - Fixed
- ~~`cf_space_id` is required but not available from current configuration~~ - Fixed
- External dependencies (https_proxy, s3_id, logdrain_id) are defined but not used

### 3. **Authentication Configuration**
- Auth service is completely commented out in `auth.tf`
- Auth routes in Kong configuration reference non-existent auth service
- Missing auth service breaks the entire API gateway setup

### 4. **Missing Kong Preparation Script**
- Kong module references `prepare-kong.sh` script that doesn't exist
- This would cause Kong deployment to fail

### 5. **Network Policy Issues**
- Network policies reference auth app that isn't deployed
- Missing network policies for some service communications

### 6. **Environment Variable Issues**
- `.env` file has placeholder values that need to be replaced
- Some required secrets are not properly configured

## Services Status

| Service | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Kong API Gateway | ⚠️ Configured | Missing prepare script, auth routes broken |
| PostgREST | ✅ Ready | No major issues |
| Storage | ✅ Ready | S3 module issues fixed |
| Studio | ✅ Ready | Depends on meta service |
| Postgres Meta | ✅ Ready | No major issues |
| Auth (GoTrue) | ❌ Disabled | Completely commented out |
| Database | ✅ Ready | No major issues |
| S3 Bucket | ✅ Ready | Module configuration fixed |

## Deployment Blockers

### High Priority
1. **Auth Service Missing**: Core authentication is disabled
2. **Kong Script Missing**: API gateway won't deploy

### Medium Priority
3. **Network Policies**: Some service-to-service communication may fail
4. **Environment Configuration**: Placeholder values need real secrets

### Low Priority
5. **External Dependencies**: Proxy/logging services not integrated
6. **Resource Optimization**: Default settings may not be production-ready

## Resource Dependencies

    A[Database] --> B[All Services]
    C[S3 Bucket] --> D[Storage Service]
    E[Kong] --> F[All API Routes]
    G[Auth Service] --> E
    H[PostgREST] --> E
    I[Storage] --> E
    J[Studio] --> E
    K[Meta] --> E
    L[Meta] --> J
```

## Estimated Effort to Fix

- **Immediate (1-2 hours)**: Fix variable definitions and Kong script
- **Short-term (4-8 hours)**: Enable and configure auth service
- **Medium-term (1-2 days)**: Full integration testing and optimization
- **Long-term (1 week)**: Production hardening and monitoring setup
